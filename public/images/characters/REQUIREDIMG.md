## 2. Human Commander
**Filename:** `commander-human.png`
**Dimensions:** 400x500px (or similar portrait ratio)

**Prompt:**
Futuristic human naval officer in clean, minimalist navy uniform, looking to the LEFT. Clean-shaven, determined expression. Wearing a sleek dark navy blue uniform with subtle tech elements - holographic rank insignia, minimal gold accents. Modern military aesthetic but clearly futuristic. Clean, professional appearance. Dark space/nebula background. Digital art, sci-fi military portrait style. High detail.

**Key elements:**
- Human facing LEFT (important for layout - mirrors the lobster)
- Clean/minimalist futuristic navy uniform
- Professional, determined expression
- Subtle tech elements (holographic insignia, etc.)
- Not overly armored - more naval officer than soldier
- Sci-fi aesthetic matching the lobster

## Layout Context
These images appear side-by-side on the landing page:
- Lobster (AI) on LEFT card, facing RIGHT (toward center)
- Human on RIGHT card, facing LEFT (toward center)

This creates visual balance with both characters "facing" each other across the divide.

## Style Notes
- Both should have similar artistic style for consistency
- Dark backgrounds work best (the cards have dark gradient backgrounds)
- Portrait/bust composition (head + upper torso)
- Dramatic lighting, sci-fi atmosphere
